# Financial Time Series Prediction with Hybrid Deep Learning

A sophisticated machine learning project for financial market prediction that combines technical analysis indicators with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, featuring an attention-enhanced CNN-GRU ensemble model.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive pipeline for financial time series forecasting, leveraging both traditional technical indicators and modern deep learning techniques. The system uses Random Forest for feature engineering and selection, followed by a hybrid neural network architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms.

## Key Features

### Technical Indicators
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** - Trend identification with adaptive weighting
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)** - Momentum oscillator for overbought/oversold conditions
- **Volatility Measures** - Market risk and price variation analysis
- **Bollinger Bands** - Price envelope indicators for volatility breakouts
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** - Trend-following momentum indicator
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)** - Baseline trend smoothing
- Additional proprietary indicators
